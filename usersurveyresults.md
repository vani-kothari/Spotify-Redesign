## üí° Research Insights for Design

### Key Behavioral Patterns Identified
1. **Mental Categorization:** Users already think about playlists in categories but interface doesn't support this
2. **Task-Oriented Search:** Users search with specific actions in mind, not just discovery
3. **Context-Switching:** Users want different content types at different times
4. **Efficiency Over Discovery:** Speed of common tasks more important than new feature discovery

### Design Implications
- **Information Architecture:** Must support natural categorization patterns
- **Interaction Design:** Reduce steps between search and action
- **Content Organization:** Provide focused experiences rather than mixed feeds
- **Accessibility:** Voice and quick access are accessibility needs, not just conveniences
