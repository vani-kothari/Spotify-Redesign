## 🧠 Key Design Decisions & Rationale

### **Decision #1: Why Playlist Categories vs. Search-Based Organization?**

**Rationale:** User research revealed that people naturally think in categories (my music vs. discovered music vs. collaborative music) rather than chronological or alphabetical order. The categorization system matches users' existing mental models, reducing cognitive load.

**Alternative Considered:** Enhanced search within playlists
**Why Rejected:** Search requires users to remember playlist names and doesn't solve the organization problem

### **Decision #2: Why Three-Dot Menu vs. Swipe Gestures for Quick Actions?**

**Rationale:** The three-dot menu follows established Android and iOS conventions, ensuring users can predict functionality without learning new interaction patterns. It's also more accessible than swipe gestures.

**Alternative Considered:** Swipe-to-add gestures
**Why Rejected:** Swipe gestures are less discoverable and can conflict with scrolling behavior

### **Decision #3: Why Tabs vs. Filters for Home Content Organization?**

**Rationale:** Tabs provide immediate visual indication of available content types and enable more focused, personalized experiences. Filters would still show mixed content, just reduced.

**Alternative Considered:** Advanced filtering system
**Why Rejected:** Filters add complexity and don't address the fundamental issue of content focus

### **Decision #4: Why Profile Overlay vs. Dedicated Profile Screen?**

**Rationale:** The overlay maintains context while providing access to account features. Users can quickly access settings without losing their place in their primary task.

**Alternative Considered:** Redesigned profile screen
**Why Rejected:** Full-screen navigation disrupts user flow and adds unnecessary steps
